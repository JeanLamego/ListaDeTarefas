## 📜 Technologies

The Task List app was built using standard web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, alongside the ReactJS library. This allows users to experience a responsive and interactive interface.

The code employs components to divide functionalities, making maintenance straightforward. Utilizing the `useState` hook, tasks can be added, removed, and updated effortlessly. It's also possible to mark tasks as completed, filter them, and organize them alphabetically. Methods like `map`, `filter`, and `sort` are used to manipulate the task list, enabling efficient filtering, sorting, and display.

The app follows the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) pattern, allowing temporary creation, viewing, editing, and removal of tasks within the session. The interface is designed to be friendly, practical, and intuitive.

In summary, the Task List app is a showcase of standard web technologies and the power of ReactJS, with a focus on simplifying the management of daily tasks.
